<h2 id="how-to-create-a-notice-block">How to create a notice block</h2>
<p>Creating notices from your paragraphs works the same way as creating <a href="LINKILYNKI">leading post paragraphs</a>.<br />
You need to add a correct class <strong>after</strong> the paragraph:
&lt;!–-break-–&gt;</p>
<pre><code>Sea otters [hold each other’s paws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTvX-CkfqRo) when they sleep so they don’t drift apart.  
That is a fact, look it up on Wikipedia if you don't believe me.
{: .notice}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="available-options">Available options</h2>
<h3 id="regular-notice-block">Regular notice block</h3>
<p><code>{: .notice}</code></p>

<p class="notice">Sea otters <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTvX-CkfqRo">hold each other’s paws</a> when they sleep so they don’t drift apart.<br />
That is a fact, look it up on Wikipedia if you don’t believe me.</p>

<h3 id="alert-notice-block">Alert notice block</h3>
<p><code>{: .notice-alert}</code></p>

<p class="notice-alert">If one examines the capitalist paradigm of context, one is faced with a
choice: either accept textual narrative or conclude that reality serves to
exploit the Other.</p>

<h3 id="success-notice-block">Success notice block</h3>
<p><code>{: .notice-success}</code></p>

<p class="notice-success">If one examines the capitalist paradigm of context, one is faced with a
choice: either accept textual narrative or conclude that reality serves to
exploit the Other.</p>

<h2 id="multi-paragraph-notice-blocks">Multi-paragraph notice blocks</h2>
<p>The easiest solution I found to wrapping more than paragraph into a notice is just inserting it into a markdown-enabled <code>div</code> tag, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="notice" markdown="1"&gt;
If one examines the capitalist paradigm of context, one is faced with a
choice: either accept textual narrative or conclude that reality serves to
exploit the Other.

A number of dematerialisms concerning textual objectivism
exist. However, if textual narrative holds, we have to choose between
precultural theory and the conceptual paradigm of consensus.
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which, when processed by kramdown, shows up like this:</p>
<div class="notice">
